Purpose: Implements a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification using TensorFlow Lite, simulating an Edge AI application for real-time recyclable item recognition.
Functionality:
Trains a CNN on a simulated dataset of 64x64 images (2 classes: recyclable vs. non-recyclable).
Converts the model to TensorFlow Lite for deployment on edge devices like Raspberry Pi.
Includes a report on Edge AI benefits (low latency, privacy, offline capability) and deployment steps.


Dependencies:
Python 3.8+
TensorFlow 2.10+
NumPy
Scikit-learn


Usage:python edge_ai_prototype.py


Replace the simulated dataset with a real dataset (e.g., images of plastics, paper) for practical use.
Deploy the generated recyclable_classifier.tflite on an edge device with a camera for real-time sorting.


Output: Prints test accuracy and saves the TFLite model.

2. quantum_circuit.py

Purpose: Demonstrates a simple quantum circuit using Qiskit to simulate Grover’s search algorithm, illustrating Quantum AI’s potential for optimization tasks like drug discovery.
Functionality:
Creates a 2-qubit quantum circuit with Hadamard gates, a controlled-Z gate (oracle), and measurement.
Simulates the circuit using Qiskit’s Aer backend with 1000 shots.
Includes an explanation of how Grover’s algorithm accelerates AI tasks, such as searching molecular databases.


Dependencies:
