# Explanation: Quantum AI Application
"""
This circuit implements a simplified Grover’s search, which can optimize AI tasks like drug discovery. In drug discovery, Grover’s algorithm can search molecular databases quadratically faster than classical AI, identifying viable compounds for testing. For example, finding a molecule with specific binding properties from a database of 10^6 compounds could take seconds instead of hours, accelerating development of treatments for diseases like cancer.
